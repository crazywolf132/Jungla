## What is @jungla/stack ?

Jungla Stack is the backend version of JUNGLA. It allows for the developers to host a REST API through JUNGLA. The benefit to this is, JUNGLA is automatically implemented to all endpoints. This allows for quicker development times.

### REST API

`@jungla/stack` uses [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) in its core, to serve all the endpoints.

?> Jungla Stack is a cover over an ExpressJS server with a few custom functions and middleware pre-installed. All of this can manually be done, it is just done for ease of use.
